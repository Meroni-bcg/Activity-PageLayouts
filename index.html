    <strong>Becoming a Scientist</strong>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Plan B was to get a PhD in Chemical Engineering.<br>
    I scored a project at DRI where I
    3D printed an <br>apparatus with a running current that created flocks,<br> separating contaminated water.
    Densly flourinated <br> water is a major issue impacting development. <br>My idea was then used to provide millions of <br>
     gallons of clean safe water for developing countries.<br>(Reflecting US EPA standards) </p>

    <strong>Government Research</strong>

    <p>I was recognized for my data extraction/translation skills <br>
      and was implemented as a Research Data 
    Analyst for Fire <br>
     and Rescue Station 1 in Las Vegas. Through this opportunity,<br>
    I aided in funding a program to use alternative modes of <br>
    transportation, in less critical situations for 911 calls. <br>
    This reduced the cost of transport to the patients and the <br>
     facility. As well achieving a faster EMS response time.<br>
     Now averaging a response time of 7minutes & 34 seconds. </p>

    <strong>Laboratory Assistant</strong>
</div>
<div>
    <p>To be a competitive candidate for Medical School,<br> I needed more
   patient interaction and clinical hours.<br> I learned phlebotomy,
 how to process samples, and <br> gained experience with a diverse
 population ranging <br>from pediatrics to geriatrics. I graduated
 and applied<br> for Medical school with a 508 MCAT Score.
 I realized,<br> becoming a suregon would be a barrier to seeing my son <br>grow.
 I withdrew my applications & saught out a career in tech!
